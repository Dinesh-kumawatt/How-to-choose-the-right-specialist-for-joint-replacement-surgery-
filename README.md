# How-to-choose-the-right-specialist-for-joint-replacement-surgery-

Joint pain is not fun. Whether it’s your knees, hips, or shoulder – it starts as discomfort, then becomes pain while walking, and before you know it, even sitting or sleeping gets difficult. When painkillers and physio stop working, doctors suggest joint replacement surgery.

But how do you pick the right specialist? It’s a big decision.

First, check experience. Not every orthopedic does joint replacements. You want someone who has done hundreds or thousands of cases, and is trained in modern techniques like minimally invasive or robotic surgery. At Care and Cure Hospital, Dr. Tejas Gandhi has done over 4,000 joint surgeries and has 18+ years of experience.

Second, ask about the type of implants. Good doctors will explain which implant is used, how long it lasts, and why it’s the best for your body weight and age. It’s not a one-size-fits-all surgery.

Also, check if the hospital has ICU, physiotherapy, operation theatre and post-op rehab. Joint replacement needs team care – not just one doctor. You'll need pain management, physio, infection control, and regular follow-ups. All under one roof helps faster healing.

Look at patient reviews, ask your local friends, and don’t be shy to get a second opinion before surgery. And please, avoid unverified “cheap” surgeries. It’s your body, not a bargain deal.
